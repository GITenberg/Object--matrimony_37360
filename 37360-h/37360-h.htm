<div class="unindent">EAL ESTATE!" Philip
Margolius cried bitterly;
"that's a business
for a business man!
If a feller's in the
clothing business and it comes
bad times, Mr. Feldman, he can
sell it his goods at cost and live
anyhow; but if a feller's in the
real-estate business, Mr. Feldman,
and it comes bad times, he can't
not only sell his houses, but he
couldn't give 'em away yet, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
when the second mortgage forecloses
he gets deficiency judgments
against him."</div>

<p>"Why don't you do this?" Mr.
Feldman suggested. "Why don't
you go to the second mortgagee and
tell him you'll convey the houses to
him in satisfaction of the mortgage?
Those houses will never bring even
the amount of the first mortgage
in these times, and surely he would
rather have the houses than a deficiency
judgment against you."</p>

<p>"That's what I told him a hundred
times. Believe me, Mr.
Feldman, I used hours and hours
of the best salesmanship on that
feller," Margolius answered, "and
all he says is that he wouldn't have
to pay no interest, insurance and
taxes on a deficiency judgment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
while a house what stands vacant
you got to all the time be paying
out money."</p>

<p>"But as soon as they put the
subway through," Mr. Feldman
continued, "that property around
Two Hundred and Sixty-fourth
Street and Heidenfeld Avenue will
go up tremendously."</p>

<p>"Sure I know," Margolius
agreed; "but when a feller's got
four double flat-houses and every
flat yet vacant, futures don't cut
no ice. Them tenants couldn't
ride on futures, Mr. Feldman; and
so, with the nearest trolley car ten
blocks away, I am up against a dead
proposition."</p>

<p>"Wouldn't he give you a year's
extension?" Mr. Feldman asked.</p>

<p>"He wouldn't give me positively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
nothing," Margolius replied
hopelessly. "That feller's a regular
Skylark. He wants his pound of
meat every time, Mr. Feldman.
So I guess you got to think up some
scheme for me that I should beat
him out. Them mortgages falls
due in ten days, Mr. Feldman, and
we got to act quick."</p>

<p>Mr. Feldman frowned judicially.
In New York, if an attorney for a
realty owner knows his business
and neglects his professional ethics
he can so obstruct an action to
foreclose a mortgage as to make
Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce look like a
summary proceeding. But Henry
D. Feldman was a conscientious
practitioner, and never did anything
that might bring him before
the grievance committee of the Bar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
Association. Moreover, he was a
power in the Democratic organization
and right in line for a Supreme
Court judgeship, and so it behooved
him to be careful if not ethical.</p>

<p>"Why don't you go and see
Goldblatt again, and then if you
can't move him I'll see what I can
do for you?" Feldman suggested.</p>

<p>"But, Mr. Feldman," Margolius
protested, "I told it you it ain't no
use. Goldblatt hates me worser as
poison."</p>

<p>Feldman leaned back in his low
chair with one arm thrown over
the back, after the fashion of
Judge Blatchford's portrait in the
United States District Courtroom.</p>

<p>"See here, Margolius: what's the
real trouble between you and Goldblatt?"
he said. "If you're going<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
to get my advice in this matter you
will have to tell me the whole truth.
<i>Falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus</i>,
you know."</p>

<p>"You make a big mistake, Mr.
Feldman," Margolius replied. "It
ain't nothing like that, and whoever
told it you is got another think
coming. The trouble was about
his daughter Fannie. You could
bring a horse a pail of water, Mr.
Feldman, but no one could make
the horse drink it if he don't want
to, and that's the way it was with
me. Friedman, the Schatchen,
took me up to see Goldblatt's
daughter Fannie, and I assure you
I ain't exaggeration a bit when I
tell you she's got a moustache what
wouldn't go bad with a dago
barber yet."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why, I thought Goldblatt's
daughter was a pretty good looker,"
Feldman exclaimed.</p>

<p>"That's Birdie Goldblatt," Margolius
replied, blushing. "But
Fannie&mdash;that's a different proposition,
Mr. Feldman. Well,
Goldblatt gives me all kinds of inducements;
but I ain't that kind,
Mr. Feldman. If I would marry
I would marry for love, and it
wouldn't make no difference to me
if the girl would have it, say, for
example, only two thousand dollars.
I would marry her anyway."</p>

<p>"Very commendable," Mr. Feldman
murmured.</p>

<p>"But Fannie Goldblatt&mdash;that
is somebody a young feller wouldn't
consider, not if her hair hung with
diamonds, Mr. Feldman," Margolius<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
continued. "Although I got
to admit I did go up to Goldblatt's
house a great many times, because,
supposing she does got a moustache,
she could cook <i>gef&uuml;llte Fische</i>
and <i>Fleischkugeln</i> better as Delmonico's
already. And then Miss
Birdie Goldblatt&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He faltered and blushed again,
while Feldman nodded sympathetically.</p>

<p>"Anyhow, what's the use talking?"
Margolius concluded. "The
old man gets sore on me, and when
Marks Henochstein offers him the
second mortgages on them Heidenfeld
Avenue houses it was yet boom-time
in the Bronix, and it looked
good to Goldblatt; so he made
Henochstein give him a big allowance,
and he bought 'em.  And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
now when he's got me where he
wants me I can kiss myself good-bye
with them houses."</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and put on
his gloves, for Philip was what is
popularly known as a swell dresser.
Indeed, there was no smarter-appearing
salesman in the entire
cloak and suit trade, nor was there
a salesman more ingratiating in
manner and hence more successful
with lady buyers.</p>

<p>"If the worser comes to the
worst," he said, "I will go through
bankruptcy. I ain't got nothing
but them houses, anyway." He
fingered the two-and-a-half-carat
solitaire in his scarf to find out if
it were still there. "And they
couldn't get my salary in advance,
so that's what I'll do."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>He shook hands with Mr. Feldman.</p>

<p>"You could send me a bill for
your advice, Mr. Feldman," he
said.</p>

<p>"That's all right," Feldman replied
as he ushered his client out
of the office. "I'll add it to my
fee in the bankruptcy matter."</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h2>II</h2>

<p>About Miss Birdie Goldblatt's
appearance there was something
of Maxine Elliott with just a dash
of Anna Held, and she wore her
clothes so well that she could make
a blended-Kamchatka near-mink
scarf look like Imperial Russian
sable. Thus, when Philip Margolius
encountered her on the corner of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
Fifth Avenue and Twenty-first
Street his heart fairly jumped in
admiration. Nevertheless, he raised
his hat with all his accustomed
grace, and Miss Goldblatt bowed
and smiled in return.</p>

<p>"How d'ye do, Miss Goldblatt,"
he said. "Ain't it a fine weather?"</p>

<p>"Sure it's fine weather," Miss
Goldblatt agreed. "Is that all you
stopped me for to tell me it was
fine weather?"</p>

<p>"No," Philip said lamely.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I guess I'll be moving
on," Miss Goldblatt announced;
"because I got a date with Fannie
up on Twenty-third Street."</p>

<p>"One minute," Philip cried. "It
was about your sister what I
wanted to speak to you about."</p>

<p>"What have you got to do with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
my sister Fannie?" Miss Goldblatt
demanded, glaring indignantly at
Margolius.</p>

<p>"Why," Philip replied on the
spur of the moment, "I got a
friend what wants to be introduced
to her, a&mdash;now&mdash;feller in the&mdash;now&mdash;cloak
business."</p>

<p>Miss Goldblatt regarded Philip
for one suspicious moment.</p>

<p>"What's his name?" she asked
abruptly.</p>

<p>A gentle perspiration broke out
on Philip's forehead. He searched
his mind for the name of some
matrimonially eligible man of his
acquaintance, but none suggested
itself. Hence, he sparred for
time.</p>

<p>"Never mind his name," he said
jocularly. "When the time comes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
I'll tell you his name. He's got it
a good business, too, I bet yer."</p>

<p>Miss Goldblatt grew somewhat
mollified.</p>

<p>"Why don't you bring him down
to the house some night?" she
suggested, whereat Philip could not
forbear an ironical laugh.</p>

<p>"I suppose your father would be
delighted to see me, I suppose.
Ain't it?" he said.</p>

<p>"What's he got to do with it?"
Miss Goldblatt asked. "Do you
think because he's called in them
second mortgages that me and
Fannie would stand for his being
fresh to you if you was to come
round to the house?"</p>

<p>"No, I don't," Philip replied;
"but just the same, anyhow, he
feels sore at me."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's got a right to feel sore at
you," Miss Goldblatt interrupted.
"You come a dozen times to see
my sister, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's where you are mistaken,"
Philip cried; "I come once, the first
time, to see your sister, and the
other times I come to see <i>you</i>."</p>

<p>"Ain't you got a nerve?" Miss
Goldblatt exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Why do I got a nerve?" Philip
asked. "Miss Goldblatt&mdash;Birdie,
what's the matter with me, anyway?
I'm young yet&mdash;I ain't
only thirty-two&mdash;and I got a good
name in the cloak and suit business
as a salesman. Ask anybody. I
can make it my five thousand a
year easy. And supposing I am a
foreigner? There's lots of up-to-date
American young fellers what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
couldn't keep you in hairpins,
Birdie."</p>

<p>He paused and looked pleadingly
at Birdie, who tossed her head in
reply.</p>

<p>"Them houses up in the Bronix,"
he said, "that's a misfortune what
could happen anybody. If I got
to let 'em go I'll do it. But pshaw!
I could make it up what I lost in
them houses with my commissions
for one good season already."</p>

<p>"Well, my sister Fannie&mdash;&mdash;"
Birdie commenced.</p>

<p>"Never mind your sister Fannie,"
Philip said. "I will look
out for her. If you and me can
fix it up, Birdie, I give you my word
and honour as a gentleman I will
fix it up for Fannie a respectable
feller with a good business."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused for an expression of
opinion from Birdie, but none was
forthcoming.</p>

<p>"What are you doing to-night?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Fannie and me was&mdash;&mdash;" she
began.</p>

<p>"Not Fannie&mdash;<i>you</i>," he broke
in. "Because I was going to suggest
if you ain't doing nothing
might we would go to theaytre?"</p>

<p>"Well, sure," Birdie continued.
"Fannie and me could go and we
wouldn't say nothing to the old
man about it."</p>

<p>"Looky here," Philip pleaded,
"must Fannie go?"</p>

<p>"Sure she must go," Birdie
answered. "Otherwise, if she don't
go I won't go."</p>

<p>Philip pondered for a moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well&mdash;&mdash;" he commenced.</p>

<p>"And why wouldn't it be a good
scheme," Birdie went on, "if you
was to ring in this other young
feller?"</p>

<p>"What young feller?" Philip innocently
asked her.</p>

<p>"What young feller!" Birdie
exclaimed. "Why, ain't you just
told me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's right!" Philip cried.
"That's a good idee. I'll see if I
can fix it."</p>

<p>He stopped short and looked at
his watch. "I'll meet you both
in front of the Casino at eight
o'clock," he declared.</p>

<p>It was five o'clock and he only
had a trifle over three hours to
discover a man&mdash;young if possible,
but, in any event, prosperous,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
who would be willing to conduct to
the theatre a lady of uncertain age
with a dark moustache&mdash;object:
matrimony.</p>

<p>"You must excuse me," he said
fervently as he shook Birdie's hand
in farewell. "I got a lot of work
to do this afternoon."</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h2>III</h2>

<p>On his way to the office of
Schindler &amp; Baum, his employers,
he was a prey to misgivings of the
gloomiest kind.</p>

<p>"I got such a chance of getting
a feller for that Fannie like I would
never try at all," he murmured to
himself; but, as he turned the
corner of Nineteenth Street, Fortune,
which  occasionally favours<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the brave, brought him into violent
contact with a short, stout person
proceeding in the opposite direction.</p>

<p>"Why don't you hire it a whole
sidewalk for yourself?" Philip began,
and then he recognized the
stout gentleman.</p>

<p>"Why, hallo, Mr. Feigenbaum!"
he cried.</p>

<p>"Hallo yourself, Margolius!"
Feigenbaum grunted. "It's a
wonder you wouldn't murder me
yet, the way you go like a steam
engine already."</p>

<p>"Excuse me," Philip said. "Excuse
<i>me</i>, Mr. Feigenbaum. I didn't
see you coming. I got to wear
glasses, too."</p>

<p>Mr. Feigenbaum glared at
Philip with his left eye, the glare<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
in his right eye being entirely
beyond control, since it was fixed
and constant as the day it was
made.</p>

<p>"What are you trying to do,
Margolius?" he asked. "Kid me?"</p>

<p>"Kid you!" Philip repeated.
"Why should I want to kid you?"</p>

<p>And then for the first time it
occurred to him that not only was
One-eye Feigenbaum proprietor of
the H. F. Cloak Company and its
six stores in the northern-tier
counties of Pennsylvania, but that
he was also a bachelor. Moreover,
a bachelor with one eye and
the singularly unprepossessing appearance
of Henry Feigenbaum
would be just the kind of person
to present to Fannie Goldblatt, for
Feigenbaum, by reason of his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
infirmity, could not cavil at Fannie's
black moustache, and as for
Fannie&mdash;well, Fannie would be
glad to take what she could get.</p>

<p>"Come over to Hammersmith's
and take a little something, Mr.
Feigenbaum," he said. "You and
me hasn't had a talk together in a
long time."</p>

<p>Feigenbaum followed him across
the street and a minute later sat
down at a table in Hammersmith's
rear caf&eacute;.</p>

<p>"What will you take, Mr.
Feigenbaum?" Philip asked as the
waiter bent over them solicitously.</p>

<p>"Give me a package of all-tobacco
cigarettes," Feigenbaum
ordered, "and a rye-bread tongue
sandwich."</p>

<p>Philip asked for a cup of coffee.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Looky here, Feigenbaum,"
Philip commenced after they had
been served, "you and me is
known each other now since way
before the Spanish War already,
when I made my first trip by Sol
Unterberg. Why is it I ain't never
sold you a dollar's worth of
goods?"</p>

<p>"No, and you never will, Margolius,"
Feigenbaum said as he
licked the crumbs from his fingers;
"and I ain't got a thing against
you, because I think you're a
decent, respectable young feller."</p>

<p>Having thus endorsed the character
of his host, Feigenbaum lit a
cigarette and grinned amiably.</p>

<p>"But Schindler &amp; Baum got it
a good line, Feigenbaum," Philip
protested.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"Sure I know they got it a good
line," Feigenbaum agreed; "but I
ain't much on going to theaytres
or eating a bunch of expensive
feed. No, Margolius, I like to deal
with people what gives their line
the benefit of the theaytres and
the dinners."</p>

<p>"What you mean?" Philip cried.</p>

<p>"I mean Ellis Block, from Saracuse,
New York, shows me a line of
capes he bought it from you, Margolius,"
Feigenbaum continued,
"which the precisely same thing I
got it down on Division Street at a
dollar less apiece from a feller what
never was inside of so much as a
moving pictures, with or without a
customer, Margolius, and so he
don't got to add the tickets to the
price of the garments."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span></p>

<p>Philip washed down a tart rejoinder
with a huge gulp.</p>

<p>"Not that I don't go to theaytre
once in a while," Feigenbaum went
on; "but when I go I pay for it
myself."</p>

<p>Philip nodded.</p>

<p>"Supposing I should tell you,
Mr. Feigenbaum," he said, "that
I didn't want to sell you no goods."</p>

<p>"Well, if you didn't want to sell
me no goods," Feigenbaum replied
with a twinkle in his eye, "the
best thing to do would be to take
me to a show, because then I sure
wouldn't buy no goods from you."</p>

<p>"All right," Philip replied;
"come and take dinner with me and
we'll go and see the Lily of Constantinople."</p>

<p>"I wouldn't take dinner with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
you because I got to see a feller
on East Broadway at six o'clock,"
Feigenbaum said; "but if you are
willing I will meet you in front of
the Casino at eight o'clock."</p>

<p>"Sure I'm willing," Philip said;
"otherwise, I wouldn't of asked
you."</p>

<p>"All right," Feigenbaum said, rising
from his chair. "Eight o'clock,
look for me in front of the Casino."</p>

<p>At seven o'clock Philip alighted
from a Forty-second Street car.
He strode into a fashionable hotel
and handed ten dollars to the clerk
in the theatre-ticket office.</p>

<p>"Give me four orchestra seats for
the Casino for to-night," he said.</p>

<p>Thence he proceeded to the grill-room
and consumed a tenderloin
steak, hashed-brown potatoes, a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
mixed salad, pastry and coffee, and
washed down the whole with a pint
of ebullient refreshment.</p>

<p>Finally, he lit a fine cigar and paid
the check, after which he took a
small morocco-bound book from his
waistcoat pocket. He turned to the
last page of a series headed, "Schindler
&amp; Baum, Expense Account,"
and made the following entry:</p>

<p>"To entertainment of Henry
Feigenbaum, $15.00."</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h2>IV</h2>

<p>The acquaintance of Henry
Feigenbaum with Miss Fannie
Goldblatt could hardly be called
love at first sight.</p>

<p>"Mr. Feigenbaum," Philip said
when they all met in front of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Casino, "this is a friend of mine
by the name Miss Fannie Goldblatt;
also, her sister Birdie."</p>

<p>The two ladies bowed, but
Feigenbaum only blinked at them
with unaffected astonishment.</p>

<p>"All right," he stammered at
last. "All right, Margolius. Let's
go inside."</p>

<p>During the short period before
the rising of the curtain Birdie and
Philip conversed in undertones,
while Fannie did her best to interest
her companion.</p>

<p>"Ain't it a pretty theaytre?" she
said by way of prelude.</p>

<p>Feigenbaum glanced around
him and grunted: "Huh, huh."</p>

<p>"You're in the same line as Mr.
Margolius, ain't you?" Fannie continued.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cloaks and suits, retail," Feigenbaum
replied. "I got six stores
in the northern-tier counties of
Pennsylvania."</p>

<p>"Then you don't live in New
York?" Fannie hazarded.</p>

<p>"No, I live in Pennsylvania,"
said Feigenbaum. "But I used to
live in New York when I was a
young feller."</p>

<p>"Why, you're a young feller
yet," Fannie suggested coyly.</p>

<p>"Me, I ain't so young no longer,"
Feigenbaum answered. "At my age
I could have it already grandchildren
old enough to bring in a couple
dollars a week selling papers."</p>

<p>"I believe you should bring up
children sensible, too," Miss Goldblatt
agreed heartily. "If I had
children I would teach 'em they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
should earn and save money
young."</p>

<p>"So?" Feigenbaum said.</p>

<p>"Sure," Miss Goldblatt continued.
"I always say that if you
make children to be economical
when they're young they're economical
when they grow up. My
poor mother, <i>selig</i>, always impressed
it on me I should be economical,
and so I am economical."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" Feigenbaum
gasped. He felt that he was a
drowning man and looked around
him for floating straws.</p>

<p>"I ain't so helpless like some
other ladies that I know," Miss
Goldblatt went on. "My poor
mother, <i>selig</i>, was a good housekeeper,
and she taught me everything
what she knew. She used<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
to say: 'The feller what gets my
Fannie won't never die of the indigestion.'"</p>

<p>Feigenbaum nodded gloomily.</p>

<p>"Did you ever suffer from stummick
trouble, Mr. Feigenbaum?"
she asked.</p>

<p>The composer of the Lily of
Constantinople came to Feigenbaum's
assistance by scoring the
opening measure of the overture
for brass and woodwind with heavy
passages for the <i>cassa grande</i> and
cymbals, and when the uproar
gave way to a simple rendition of
the song hit of the show, My Bosphorus
Queen, Fannie surrendered
herself to the spell of its marked
rhythm and forgot to press Feigenbaum
for an answer.</p>

<p>During the entire first act Feigenbaum<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
fixed his eyes on the
stage, and as soon as the curtain
fell for the first <i>entr'acte</i> he uttered
no word of apology, but made a
hurried exit to the smoking-room.
There Philip found him a moment
later.</p>

<p>"Well, Feigenbaum," Philip
cried, "how do you like the show?"</p>

<p>"The show is all right, Margolius,"
Feigenbaum replied, "but
the next time you are going to steer
me up against something like that
Miss Fannie Goldblatt, Margolius,
let me know. That's all."</p>

<p>"Why, what's the matter with
her?" Philip asked.</p>

<p>"There's nothing the matter
with her," Feigenbaum said, "only
she reminds me of a feller what used
to work by me up in Sylvania by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
the name Pincus Lurie. I had to
get rid of him because trade fell off
on account the children complained
he made snoots at 'em to scare
'em. He didn't make no snoots,
Margolius; that was his natural
face what he got it, the same like
Miss Goldblatt."</p>

<p>"You don't know that girl,
Feigenbaum," Philip replied.
"That girl's got a heart. Oi! what
a heart that girl got&mdash;like a watermelon."</p>

<p>"I know, Margolius," Feigenbaum
replied; "but she also got it
a moustache like a dago. Why don't
she shave herself, Margolius?"</p>

<p>"Why don't you ask her yourself?"
Philip said coldly.</p>

<p>"I don't know her good enough
yet," Feigenbaum retorted, "and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
how it looks now I ain't never
going to."</p>

<p>But the way to Feigenbaum's
heart lay through his stomach just
as accurately as it avoided his
pocketbook, so that when Miss
Fannie Goldblatt suggested, after
the final curtain, that they all go
up to One Hundred and Eighteenth
Street and have a supper at home
instead of at a restaurant, she made
a dent in Feigenbaum's affections.</p>

<p>"Looky here, Birdie," Philip
whispered, "how about the old
man?"</p>

<p>"Don't you worry about him,"
she said. "He went to Brownsville
to play auction pinocle, and
I bet yer he don't get home till
five o'clock."</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward they sat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
around the dining-room table, and
Fannie helped Feigenbaum to a
piece of <i>gef&uuml;llte Fische</i>, a delicacy
which never appears on the menus
of rural hotels in Pennsylvania.
At the first mouthful Feigenbaum
looked at Fannie Goldblatt, and
while, to be sure, she did have some
hair on her upper lip, it was only
a slight down which at the second
mouthful became still slighter. Indeed,
after the third slice of fish
Feigenbaum was ready to declare
it to be a most becoming down,
very bewitching and Spanish in
appearance.</p>

<p>Following the <i>gef&uuml;llte Fische</i> came
a species of <i>tripe farcie</i>, the whole
being washed down with coffee and
topped off with delicious cake&mdash;cake
which could be adequately<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
described only by kissing the tips
of one's fingers.</p>

<p>"After all, Margolius," Feigenbaum
commented as he lit an all-tobacco
cigarette on their way
down the front stoop of the Goldblatt
residence&mdash;"after all, she
ain't such a bad-looking woman.
I seen it lots worser, Margolius."</p>

<p>"That's nothing what we got it
this evening," Philip said as they
started off for the subway; "you
should taste the <i>Kreploch</i> what
that girl makes it."</p>

<p>"I'm going to," Feigenbaum
said; "they asked me I should come
to dinner to-morrow night."</p>

<p>But Philip knew from his own
experience that the glamour engendered
of Fannie's <i>gef&uuml;llte Fische</i>
would soon be dispelled, and then<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
Henry Feigenbaum would hie him
to the northern-tier counties of
Pennsylvania, leaving Philip's love
affair in worse condition than before.</p>

<p>"I got to cinch it," he murmured
to himself as he went downtown
next morning, "before that one-eyed
feller skips out on me."</p>

<p>As soon as he reached Schindler
&amp; Baum's office he rang up the
Goldblatt house, assuming for that
purpose a high tenor voice lest Goldblatt
himself answer the 'phone;
but again fortune favoured him, and
it was Birdie who responded.</p>

<p>"Birdie," he said, "do me the
favour and come to lunch with me
at the Park Row Building."</p>

<p>"Why so far downtown?" Birdie
asked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>"Reasons I got it," Philip replied.
"Come at twelve o'clock
at the Park Row Building, sure."</p>

<p>Thus it happened at quarter
past twelve Philip and Birdie sat
at a table in the Park Row Building
in such earnest conversation
that a tureenful of soup remained
unserved before them at a temperature
of seventy degrees.</p>

<p>"An engagement party ain't
nothing to me," Philip cried.
"What do I care for such things?"</p>

<p>"But it's something to me,
Philip," Birdie declared. "Think
of the presents, Philip."</p>

<p>"Presents!" Philip repeated.
"What for presents would we get
it? Bargains in cut glass what
would make our flat look like a
five-and-ten-cent store."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>"But Popper would be crazy if
I did a thing like that," Birdie
protested. "And, besides, I ain't
got no clothes."</p>

<p>"Why, you look like a&mdash;like
a&mdash;now&mdash;queen," Philip exclaimed.
"And, anyhow, what
would you want new clothes for
when you got this?"</p>

<p>He dug his hand into his trousers
pocket and produced a ring containing
a solitaire diamond as big
as a hazelnut.</p>

<p>"I took a chance on the size
already," he said, "but I bet yer
it will fit like it was tailor-made."</p>

<p>He seized her left hand in both
of his and passed the ring on to the
third finger, while Birdie's cheeks
were aglow and her eyes rivalled
the brilliancy of the ring itself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"But&mdash;&mdash;" she began.</p>

<p>"But nothing," Philip interrupted.
He rose from his seat and
helped Birdie on with her coat.
"Waiter," he called, "we come
right back here. We are just
going over to Jersey for a couple
of hours."</p>

<p>He pressed a bill into the waiter's
hand.</p>

<p>"Send that soup to the kitchen,"
he said, "and tell 'em to serve it
hot when we come back."</p>

<p>Two hours later they reappeared
at the same table, and the grinning
waiter immediately went off to the
kitchen. When he returned he bore
a glass bowl containing a napkin
elaborately folded in the shape
of a flower, and inside the napkin
was a little heap of rice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h2>V</h2>

<p>There was something about Mr.
Elkan Goldblatt's face that would
make the most hardy real-estater
pause before entering into a business
deal with him. He had an
eye like a poll-parrot with its concomitant
beak, and his closely
cropped beard and moustache accentuated
rather than mollified his
harsh appearance.</p>

<p>"Such fellers I wouldn't have
no more mercy on than a dawg,"
he said to his attorney, Eleazer
Levy. "Oncet already I practically
kicked him out from my
house, and then he's got the nerve
to come back, and two weeks ago
he brings yet a feller with him
and makes bluffs that the feller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
wants to marry my daughter Fannie."</p>

<p>"He was just trying to get you
to extend those second mortgages,
I suppose," Levy said.</p>

<p>"Sure he was, because this here
feller&mdash;a homely looking feller
with one eye, mind you&mdash;says
he got to go back to Pennsylvania
where his stores is, and we ain't
seen nor heard a word from him
since," Goldblatt concluded. "And
him eating two meals a day by us
for ten days yet!"</p>

<p>Eleazer Levy clucked with his
tongue in sympathy.</p>

<p>"But, anyhow, now I want we
should go right straight ahead
and foreclose on Margolius," Goldblatt
continued. "Don't lose no
time, Levy, and get out the papers<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
to-day. How long would it be
before we can sell the property?"</p>

<p>"Six weeks," said Levy, "if I
serve the summons to-morrow. I
put in a search some days ago, and
the feller ain't got a judgment
against him."</p>

<p>"So much the better," Goldblatt
commented. "The property
won't bring the amount of the
first mortgage and I suppose I got
to buy it in. Then I will get deficiency
judgments against that
feller, and I'll make him sorry he
ever tried any monkey business
with me and my daughters. Why,
that feller actually turned my own
children against me, Levy."</p>

<p>"Is that so?" Levy murmured.</p>

<p>"My Birdie abused me, I assure
you, like I was a pickpocket when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
I says I would foreclose on him,"
Goldblatt replied. "And even my
Fannie, although she is all broke
up about that one-eyed feller, she
says I should give the young feller
a show. What d'ye think of that,
hey?"</p>

<p>"Terrible!" Levy replied. "A
feller like that deserves all he gets,
and you can bet yer sweet life he
won't have any let-up from me,
Mr. Goldblatt."</p>

<p>Levy was as good as his word, for
that very afternoon he filed a notice
of pendency of action against the
Heidenfeld Avenue property, and
the next morning, as Philip left
his house, a clerk from Levy's office
served him with four copies of the
summons and complaint in the
foreclosure suit of Goldblatt vs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
Margolius, actions numbers 1, 2,
3 and 4. But Philip stuffed them
into his pocket unread; he had
other and more poignant woes than
foreclosure suits. Only ten days
wed, and he was denied even the
sight of his wife longer than five
minutes; for she was not endangering
future prospects in favour of
present happiness.</p>

<p>"We could, anyway, get the
furniture out of him," she argued
when she saw Philip that day,
"and, maybe, a couple of thousand
dollars."</p>

<p>"I don't care a pinch of snuff for
his furniture," Philip cried. "I will
buy the furniture myself."</p>

<p>"But I can't leave Fannie just
now,"  she declared; "she's all
broke up about that feller."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>

<p>"What about me?" Philip protested.
"Ain't I broke up, too?"</p>

<p>"So long you waited, you could
wait a little longer yet," she replied;
"but poor Fannie, you got no idea
how that girl takes on."</p>

<p>"She shouldn't worry," Philip
cried. "I promised I would fix
her up, and I will fix her up."</p>

<p>Daily the same scene was enacted
at the Goldblatt residence
on One Hundred and Eighteenth
Street, and daily Birdie refused to
forsake her sister, until six weeks
had elapsed.</p>

<p>"But, Birdie," Philip announced
for the hundredth time, "so sure
as you stand there I couldn't keep
this up no longer. I will either
go crazy or either I will jump in
the river."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Birdie patted him on the back.</p>

<p>"Don't think about it," she
said. "Take your mind off it. To-day
your property gets sold and
Popper says he will be down at the
salesroom at twelve o'clock."</p>

<p>"Let 'em sell it," Philip cried;
"I don't care."</p>

<p>He turned away after a hurried
embrace, and was proceeding down
Lenox Avenue toward the subway
when Marks Henochstein, the
real-estate broker, encountered
him. Marks clutched him by the
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Well, Philip," Henochstein
cried, "you are in luck at last."</p>

<p>"In luck!" Philip exclaimed bitterly.
"A dawg shouldn't have
the luck what I got it."</p>

<p>"Well, if you don't call it lucky,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Henochstein continued, "what
would you call it lucky?"</p>

<p>"Excuse me, Henochstein," said
Philip; "I ain't good at guessing
puzzles. What am I lucky for?"</p>

<p>"Why, ain't you heard it yet?"</p>

<p>"I ain't heard nothing," Philip
replied. "Do me the favour and
don't keep me on suspension."</p>

<p>"Why, the city is going to widen
Two Hundred and Sixty-fourth
Street in front of them houses of
yours, and you will get damages.
Oi! what damages you will get!"</p>

<p>Philip stared blankly at his informant
for one hesitating moment;
then he dashed off for the nearest
subway station.</p>

<p>Half an hour later he sat in the
office of Henry D. Feldman and
gasped out his story.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>"In three quarters of an hour,
Mr. Feldman," he cried, "that
property will be sold, and, if it is,
the feller what buys it will get
damages for the street opening and
I will get nix."</p>

<p>"This is a fine time to tell me
about it, Margolius," Feldman
said. "You came in here six weeks
ago and asked me to help you out,
and I haven't seen you since. The
time to do something was six weeks
ago. Why didn't you come back
to see me before the suit was
started?"</p>

<p>"Because I was busy, Mr. Feldman,"
Margolius replied. "A whole
lot of things happened to me about
that time. In the first place, the
next day after I saw you I got
married."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>

<p>"What!" Feldman exclaimed,
"you got married? Well, Margolius,
you recovered pretty quickly
from that affair with Birdie Goldblatt."</p>

<p>Margolius stared gloomily at
his attorney.</p>

<p>"What d'ye mean I recover
from it?" he echoed. "I didn't
recover from it, Mr. Feldman.
That's who I married&mdash;Miss
Birdie Goldblatt."</p>

<p>Feldman sat back in his chair.</p>

<p>"Well, of all the unfatherly
brutes," he said, "to shut down on
his own daughter's husband!"</p>

<p>"Hold on there, Mr. Feldman,"
Philip interrupted; "he don't know
he's shutting down on his daughter's
husband, because we was secretly
married, y' understand? And even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
to-day yet the old man don't know
nothing about it."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Feldman
asked. "Why wouldn't he
know his own daughter was married?"</p>

<p>"Because she's living home yet,"
Philip replied, and "I can't persuade
her to go housekeeping,
neither."</p>

<p>Feldman frowned for a moment
and then he struck the desk with
his fist.</p>

<p>"By jiminy!" he shouted,
"you've got the old man by the
whiskers!"</p>

<p>It was now Philip's turn to ask
what Feldman meant.</p>

<p>"Why," the latter explained,
"your wife's inchoate right of dower
is still outstanding."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's where you make a big
mistake, Mr. Feldman," Philip
corrected. "My Birdie is a neat
dresser and never so much as a
pin out of place."</p>

<p>"You don't understand," Feldman
continued. "As soon as
Birdie and you got married she
took an interest in your property."</p>

<p>"Sure she took an interest in my
property," Philip assented. "Why,
if it wouldn't be for her I wouldn't
know nothing about this here sale
to-day."</p>

<p>"But I mean that as soon as she
married you she became vested
with the right to receive the rents
of a third of that property during
her lifetime as soon as you died,"
said Feldman.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, we won't worry about
that," Philip said with a deprecatory
wave of his hand, "because,
in the first place, that property is
pretty near vacant and don't bring
in enough rents to pay the taxes,
and, in the second place, I'm still
good and healthy and I wouldn't
die for a long time yet."</p>

<p>"Oh, what's the use!" Feldman
cried. "What I mean is that they
can't foreclose those second mortgages
unless they make Birdie a
party to the suit and serve her
with the summons; so, all you have
to do to stop the sale is to go down
to the salesroom and, when the
auctioneer starts to ask for bids,
get up and tell 'em all about it.
Why, they'll have to begin their
suit all over again."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>"But," Philip protested, "if I
tell 'em all about it the old man
will throw Birdie out of the
house."</p>

<p>"Hold on!" Feldman broke in.
"You mustn't tell them you're
married to Birdie. Just tell them
you're married, and let them find
out your wife's name for themselves.
Although, to be sure, that won't
take long, for the record of marriage
licenses at the city hall will
show it."</p>

<p>"License nothing!" Philip cried.
"We didn't get no license at the city
hall. We got married by a justice
of the peace in Jersey City."</p>

<p>"Fine!" Feldman exclaimed, his
professional ethics thrown to the
winds. "That'll keep 'em guessing
as long as you want."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"All I want is a month, and by
that time I can raise the money
and fix the whole thing up," Margolius
replied.</p>

<p>Feldman looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Chase yourself," he said; "it's
a quarter of twelve, and the foreclosure
sale begins at noon."</p>

<h2>VI</h2>

<p>On the rostrum of an auctioneer
in the Vesey Street salesroom stood
Eleazer Levy in weighty conversation
with Miles M. Scully, the
referee in foreclosure. Scully's
brow was furrowed into a thousand
earned wrinkles, and the little knot
of real-estate brokers who regularly
attend foreclosure sales gazed reverently
on the two advocates.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"And here was this guy," Levy
concluded, "with nothing but a
pair of sixes all the time."</p>

<p>"But in a table-stakes game,"
Scully murmured, "you make a
sight more if you don't butt into
every pot. If you think you're
topped lay 'em down. That's
what I do, and it pays."</p>

<p>They were waiting for the auctioneer
to appear, and Goldblatt
hung around the edge of the crowd
and gazed anxiously at them. He
had heard that morning of the proposed
street widening and wanted
the sale to go through without a
hitch. At length the auctioneer
arrived and the clerk read off the
notice of sale in a monotonous
gabble just as Philip elbowed his
way through the crowd.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now, then, gentlemen," the
auctioneer announced pompously,
"the four parcels will be sold separately.
Each is subject to a first
mortgage of twenty thousand dollars
and is otherwise free and clear
except the taxes. The amount of
taxes is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hey, there!" Philip cried at
this juncture. "I got something
to say, too."</p>

<p>The auctioneer paused and fixed
Philip with what was intended to
be a withering look.</p>

<p>"Put that man out!" the auctioneer
called to one of the attendants.</p>

<p>"You could put me out," Philip
yelled, "if you want to, but you
couldn't put my wife out, because
she ain't been served with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
summons and complaint in the
first place, and she ain't here in the
second place."</p>

<p>Goldblatt turned pale and
started for the rostrum, while the
auctioneer motioned the attendant
to hold off for a minute.</p>

<p>"Is he a married man?" the
auctioneer asked Levy.</p>

<p>"He's a faker," Levy replied.
"Go ahead with the sale."</p>

<p>"Am I a faker?" Philip yelled,
holding up his left hand. "Well,
look at that there ring."</p>

<p>He pulled it off with an effort and
handed it to the auctioneer.</p>

<p>"Look inside," he said. And,
sure enough, the inner side bore
the inscription: "B. G. to P. M.,
10-20-'09." Goldblatt looked at
it, too; but B. G. meant nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
to him and he handed it back to
the auctioneer.</p>

<p>"That's only a scheme what he's
trying to work it," he said. "Give
him back the ring and go ahead
with the sale."</p>

<p>"One moment," said Miles M.
Scully. "I'm the referee here,
and I ain't going to take no such
chance as that. I'm going to adjoin
this here sale one week and investigate
what this here guy says in the
meantime."</p>

<p>Forthwith, the auctioneer announced
a week's adjournment of
the four sales, and Philip resumed
his wedding ring with a parting
diabolical grin at Goldblatt, and
left the auction-room. He went to
the nearest telephone pay station
and rang up the Goldblatt residence,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
but for over half an hour
he received only Central's assurance
that as soon as there was an
answer she would call him.</p>

<p>"But, Central," he protested,
"there's got to be somebody there.
They can't all be out."</p>

<p>And Philip was right. There
were two people sitting in the front
parlour of the Goldblatt residence,
and another and more interested
person stooped in the back parlour,
with her ear to the crack of the
sliding doors which divided the two
rooms. The telephone bell trilled
impatiently at brief intervals, but
all three were oblivious to its
appeal; for the two persons in the
front parlour were engaged in
conversation of an earnest character,
and the person in the rear<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
room would not have missed a word
of it for all the telephones in the
world.</p>

<p>"Yes, Fannie," said one of the
two persons, "I come back to you,
anyhow, and I come back for
good."</p>

<p>He placed his arms around her
ample waist.</p>

<p>"I assure you, Fannie," he concluded,
"them dollar-a-day American-plan
hotels in the northern-tier
counties is nothing but poison to a
feller.  I am pretty near starved."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say so at first?"
Fannie replied, rising from the
couch where she had been sitting
with Feigenbaum. "I got some
fine <i>gef&uuml;llte Fische</i> in the ice-box."</p>

<p>Whereupon Birdie answered the
'phone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hallo!" came a voice from the
other end of the wire. "Where was
you all the time? I got some
good news for you."</p>

<p>"I've got some good news for
you, too," Birdie replied. "Fannie
and Mr. Feigenbaum are engaged."</p>

<hr class="r15" />
<h2>VII</h2>

<p>Elkan Goldblatt usually arrived
home at seven o'clock to find
his dinner smoking on the table.
His daughter Fannie always attended
to the carving, but on the
night of the foreclosure sale it was
Birdie who presided at the head
of the board.</p>

<p>"Where's Fannie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"She went out to dinner," Birdie
explained.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>Elkan nodded and lapsed into
gloomy silence.</p>

<p>"What's the matter now?" Birdie
inquired.</p>

<p>"That lowlife Margolius," he
said, "what do you think from that
loafer? He goes to work and gets
married."</p>

<p>Birdie gasped and turned white,
all of which her father mistook for
symptoms of astonishment.</p>

<p>"Ain't that a loafer for you?"
he continued. "All the time he
hangs around here, and then he
goes to work and gets married."</p>

<p>"Who did he marry?" Birdie
asked innocently.</p>

<p>"A question!" Goldblatt exclaimed.
"Who can tell it who a
lowlife like him would marry?"</p>

<p>Birdie tossed her head.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"He ain't no lowlife just because
he gets married," she retorted.
"What's more, any girl would be
glad to get a good-looking, decent
young feller like Philip Margolius."</p>

<p>Goldblatt laid down his knife and
fork.</p>

<p>"You are crazy in the head," he
said. "Why should you stick up
for a young feller what comes
around here and upsets my whole
house? <i>You</i> I don't care about,
because you could always get a
husband; but Fannie&mdash;that's different
again. It ain't enough for
that loafer that he disappointed
her himself, but he also got to
bring around here that one-eyed
feller&mdash;another such lowlife as
Margolius&mdash;and he also disappoints<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Fannie. That feller Margolius
is a dawg, Birdie, believe
me."</p>

<p>Birdie rose from her seat and
threw her napkin on to the floor.</p>

<p>"I won't sit here and listen to
such talk," she cried and ran out
of the room. For a moment Goldblatt
essayed to finish his dinner,
and then he, too, rose and followed
Birdie. He found her weeping on
the parlour lounge.</p>

<p>"Birdie!" he cried. "Birdiechen,
what are you taking on so for?"</p>

<p>"I won't have you say such
things about Ph-Ph&mdash;Feigenbaum,"
she sobbed.</p>

<p>"Why not?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because Mr. Feigenbaum came
here this afternoon and proposed
to Fannie," she explained to her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
father, "and they're downtown
now getting the ring from a friend
of his what keeps a jewellery store
on Grand Street."</p>

<p>Goldblatt sat down heavily on
the lounge and wiped his forehead.
For ten minutes he sat motionless
in the shrouded gloom of that front
parlour before he could realize his
daughter's good fortune.</p>

<p>"After all," he said finally,
"when a feller's got six stores you
could easy excuse him one eye."</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed to
talk that way," Birdie cried. "Mr.
Feigenbaum is a decent business
man, and if it wouldn't be for
Philip&mdash;Philip Margolius&mdash;Fannie
would of lived and died an old
maid."</p>

<p>At this juncture came a ring at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the bell and the sound of voices
in the hall. It was Fannie and her
fianc&eacute;, who had returned from
Grand Street, and the next moment
Goldblatt clasped his affianced
daughter in his arms and bestowed
on her great kisses that fairly resounded
down the block. Next he
grabbed Feigenbaum's hand and
shook it up and down.</p>

<p>"The happiest day what I ever
lived," he cried, slapping his new
son-in-law on the back. For almost
a quarter of an hour Fannie
and Birdie mingled their tears with
their father's embraces, and in
the midst of the excitement the
bell rang again. When the maid
opened the street door some one
inquired for Mr. Goldblatt in a
barytone voice whose familiar timbre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
chilled into silence the joyful
uproar.</p>

<p>"Margolius!" Goldblatt hissed.
He started for the hall with blood
in his eye, when Feigenbaum seized
him by the arm.</p>

<p>"Mr. Goldblatt," he said, "for
my sake don't make no fuss with
Margolius. He's a friend of mine,
and if it wouldn't be for him Fannie
and me would never of met already."</p>

<p>As Philip entered the darkened
front parlour there was a silence so
profound that he believed the room
to be empty.</p>

<p>"Excuse me," he cried when he
recognized the assembled company.
"I thought Mr. Goldblatt
was alone."</p>

<p>He turned to his father-in-law.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mr. Goldblatt, could I speak to
you for a minute by yourself?" he
asked.</p>

<p>Goldblatt coughed impressively.</p>

<p>"Margolius," he announced, "if
you got anything to say to me, say
it right here. I ain't got no private
business with you."</p>

<p>"All right," Philip replied cheerfully.
"I come here to ask you
how much would you take it for
them second mortgages what you
hold on my Two Hundred and
Sixty-fourth Street property?"</p>

<p>Goldblatt waved his hand
haughtily.</p>

<p>"You come to the wrong party,
Margolius," he said. "Because I
just made up my mind to something.
I made up my mind that
because Mr. Feigenbaum is engaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
to my Fannie I will give her
them mortgages as a marriage portion.
So you should ask Feigenbaum
that question, not me."</p>

<p>While Philip turned pale at this
announcement, Feigenbaum grew
positively crimson.</p>

<p>"Looky here, Goldblatt," he
protested to his proposed father-in-law;
"I don't want you should
unload them second mortgages on
me."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you,
Feigenbaum?" Goldblatt retorted.
"Them second mortgages is as
good as gold. Only thing is they
got to be foreclosed against Margolius'
wife."</p>

<p>"His wife!" Feigenbaum and
Fannie cried with one voice, for
Birdie had kept her secret well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," Goldblatt replied, "his
wife. That lowlife has got a wife.
But who or what she is nobody
don't know."</p>

<p>"Hold on, Goldblatt!" cried a
voice from the hall. "There's
somebody that does know."</p>

<p>The next moment a short, stout
person entered the parlour. It was
Eleazer Levy, who had rung the
bell and had been admitted to the
house unnoticed.</p>

<p>"Yes, Margolius," he said, "you
thought you could fool an old
practitioner like me. I seen you
didn't get out no license in this
county, so I hiked over to Jersey
City and, sure enough, I spotted
you."</p>

<p>He turned to Birdie.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Margolius," he said,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
"here's four copies of the supplemental
summons and amended
complaint in the foreclosure suits
of Goldblatt vs. Margolius, actions
numbers 1, 2, 3 and 4."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" Goldblatt
cried.</p>

<p>"I mean," Levy answered, "that
your daughter Birdie married
Philip Margolius in Jersey City on
the twentieth of October last."</p>

<p>Elkan Goldblatt collapsed in the
nearest chair, while Feigenbaum
ran downstairs for the bottle of
schnapps. At length Goldblatt
was restored.</p>

<p>"So, Margolius," he croaked,
"you are a thief, too. You steal
my daughter on me?"</p>

<p>"That ain't here nor there,"
Margolius said with his arm around<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
Birdie's waist and her head on his
shoulder. "That ain't here nor
there. How much will you take
it now for a satisfaction piece of
them mortgages?"</p>

<p>Goldblatt looked at Feigenbaum,
who returned his glance unmoved.</p>

<p>"For a marriage portion," Feigenbaum
declared, "second mortgages
is nix."</p>

<p>There was an embarrassing silence,
and finally Goldblatt cleared
his throat.</p>

<p>"All right, Margolius," he said;
"you married my Birdie, and I suppose
I got to stand for it, so you
can take them four second mortgages
and keep 'em as a marriage
portion yourself."</p>

<p>Birdie seized her father around
the neck and kissed him on the ear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we are forgiven? Ain't
it?" she cried.</p>

<p>"Sure you are forgiven," Goldblatt
said. "Only, Margolius has
got to pay Levy's costs and disbursements."</p>

<p>"And the referee's fees and the
auctioneer's fees," Levy added.</p>

<p>"I am agreeable," Philip replied.</p>

<p>Levy turned and beamed a benediction
on his client's reunited
family. "I wish you all joy," he
said.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
